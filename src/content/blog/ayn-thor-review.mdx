## How AYN Finally Nailed the Dual Screen

Android devices have been edging toward this form factor for a while, but the AYN Thor is the first one that absolutely nails it. The clamshell design offers ultimate portability, and when you open it, you're greeted by two beautiful displays.

Up top, we have a 6-inch OLED panel with a 120Hz refresh rate -the very same premium panel found in the AYN Odin 3.
Down below, another OLED which comes in at 3.92-inches running at 60Hz. The way these two screens interact is incredible. Using default settings, you simply tap the display you want to operate, and the physical controls become active for that screen. The bottom screen also serves as a fantastic hub for settings while playing in single-screen mode.

## Gaming Performance

The Thor comes in four main models, all running Snapdragon chips:

| Model | Storage | Ram  | Chip  |
| ----- | ------- | ---- | ----- |
| Lite  | 128GB   | 8GB  | SD865 |
| Base  | 128GB   | 8GB  | 8Gen2 |
| Pro   | 256GB   | 12GB | 8Gen2 |
| Max   | 1TB     | 16GB | 8Gen2 |

As you'd expect, the Thor excels at DS emulation (via MelonDS) and 3DS emulation (via Citra). Beyond nostalgia though, you can run pretty much anything all the way up to Nintendo Switch emulation and Steam games courtesy of GameHub. While it won't hit the performance heights of a Steam Deck, it is perfect for loading up indie titles and even some AA games from your library.
The 6,000 mAh battery provides between 2 to 8 hours of playtime depending on the intensity of the game.

Because it runs Android 13, you can use regular apps, such as Netflix and Disney+, making it versatile beyond gaming. Just note that the official PlayStation Remote Play app doesn't recognise the built-in controls. For streaming PS5, you'll want to use a third-party app like PXPlay.

## Build Quality: Hinge and Controls

The launch of the Thor hasn't been without its growing pains. Being a dual-screen device, the hinge is a focal point. Some users have reported hairline cracks, which AYN have clarified are cosmetic blemishes from the molding process rather than functional failures. Whether you believe that or not, the result has left a lot of early customers feeling disappointed. The hinge snaps into three positions, just like an original DS, and you will find yourself swapping between viewing positions in different situations.

The A, B, X, and Y buttons are firm and clicky, though they can be a bit "squeaky" until you've worn them in. Honestly, they feel great for a device of this size. On the other hand, the triggers are woeful. Because they rotate around an axis, they feel almost like a water pistol. I'm not into them at all.

Despite the thumbsticks being slightly depressed so that the clamshell can close, they have a good amount of action and rigidity, making them a joy to game on.

## Recommended Accessories

If you are picking up a Thor, you should consider accompanying it with a Nintendo Switch Stylus. A traditional DS stylus won't work on these screens due to its different display technology. However, this touch pen created for the Switch provides the precision needed for small touch targets and UI navigation, and unlike many Nintendo products these days, it doesn't actually cost that much.

In terms of AYN's own accessories, their dedicated grip slots underneath the device to provide a more comfortable, ergonomic experience in long sessions. It feels a lot more controller-like and is a must for those of us with larger hands.

AYN also offers a custom soft-shell case that fits the device and grip perfectly, as well as a transparent shell that protects the entirety of the device, while giving it a snugger, more secure fit into the TPU grip. You can even get a lanyard & pouch extra security when gaming on the go.

## The "Tinkering" Factor

The trade-off for the Thor’s flexibility is the time required to set it up. This is not a "plug-and-play" console. You will spend hours, maybe even weeks, getting your emulators and front-end set up.

Even just mapping controls for every individual emulator can be time-consuming and frustrating. But I also know that's exactly what many handheld enthusiasts love about these devices! Just remember to actually play some games, once in a while...

## Final Thoughts

The AYN Thor is a brilliant device that brings back childhood nostalgia while offering the power of a modern handheld. If you love to tinker and want a versatile dual-screen machine, the Thor is unmatched. However, if you lack the patience for 30-minute YouTube setup guides, you might be better off with a Steam Deck.

**My recommendation:** Go for the Pro or Max models. The extra power and storage are well worth the investment for a device this capable.
